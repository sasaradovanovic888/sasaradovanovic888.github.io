# Install, compile and run Kotlin from command line

**Prerequsite**: Kotlin runs on jvm, which means [java runtime](http://www.codexpedia.com/java/java-environment-set-up-guide/) is required to run it.

Install [sdkman](https://sdkman.io) from command line if it is not installed yet.

```curl -s https://get.sdkman.io | bash```
